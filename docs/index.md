## Schedule I Dedicated Server

Run a headless, authoritative server for Schedule I using the Dedicated Server Mod. The server replicates the original host flow (network, loopback client, save/load, quests, time, sleep) and is designed for long-running worlds.

### This mod is in alpha

This release is an early alpha (beta at best). You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and occasional instability. I'm releasing it in a working but not fully stable state specifically to gather community feedback and iterate quickly.

- Please search existing issues before opening a new one; if you don't see your problem reported, opening an issue on GitHub is encouraged.
- Reproduction steps, logs, and any installed mods details are extremely helpful.
- Feedback, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome and appreciated.

Thanks for helping test and shape open source Schedule I servers!
