## Gameplay settings

- `ignoreGhostHostForSleep`: ignore server loopback client in sleep readiness.
- `allowSleeping`: allow players to use beds to skip time (sleeping in a bed will likely break the client sync).
- `pauseGameWhenEmpty`: when true, pauses the world simulation while no players are connected.
- `timeNeverStops`: prevents freeze at 04:00. Server advances time continuously.
- `timeProgressionMultiplier`: speed multiplier for time progression.

These toggle/interact with Harmony patches that the server applies on startup.
